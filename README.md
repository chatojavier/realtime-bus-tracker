# Reatime Bus Tracker

This is a proyect for the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding. 

The objetive of this exercise was the use of a map API, and create live markers on it from a JSON file.

## Source Code

The source code was given by Dr. John Williams. Proffesor of this program.

## Usage

In this case I used the API from MapBox. A service of web maps with a free version.
Using open data from the Boston city goverment, I was able to create markers that show us the live locations of the city's buses. I colored each bus line with diferent color so that they can be easier to differentiate.

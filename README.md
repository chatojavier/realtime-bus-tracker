# Reatime Bus Tracker

This is a proyect for the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding. 

The objetive of this exercise was the use of a map API, and create live markers on it from a JSON file.

## Source Code

The source code was given by Dr. John Williams. Proffesor of this program.

## Usage

This was one of the javascript projects developed for the fullstack MITxPro program. In this case I used the MapBox API, a free version web map service. Using open data from the Boston city government, I was able to create markers that show us the live locations of city buses. I colored each bus line with a different color so you could tell them apart
